# Policy for verifying the blob-cli source archive
#
# This policy verifies SLSA provenance generated by the SLSA GitHub generator.
# The SLSA attestation is itself signed, providing supply chain security.
#
# Note: We rely on SLSA provenance rather than the blob signature because
# the CLI's YAML policy format uses exact identity matching, which doesn't
# support the ref suffix pattern matching needed for GitHub Actions workflows.
